  <p class="para">
   The mysqlnd replication and load balancing plugin is 
   implemented as a PHP extension.
   It is written in C and operates under the hood of PHP. During the
   startup of the PHP interpreter, in the module init phase of the 
   PHP engine, it gets registered as a
   <a href="book.mysqlnd.html" class="link">mysqlnd</a> plugin to replace selected
   mysqlnd C methods.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   At PHP run time it inspects queries send from
   mysqlnd (PHP) to the MySQL server. If a query is recognized as read-only
   it will be sent to one of the configured slave servers. Statements are
   considered read-only if they either start with <i>SELECT</i>,
   the SQL hint <i>/*ms=slave*/</i> or a slave had been choose for
   running the previous query and the query starts with the SQL hint
   <i>/*ms=last_used*/</i>. In all other cases the query will
   be sent to the MySQL replication master server.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
   The plugin takes care internally of opening and closing the database connections
   to the master server and the slave servers. From an application
   point of view there continues to be only one connection handle. However,
   internally, this one public connection handle represents a pool of
   internal connections managed by the plugin. The plugin proxies queries
   to the master server and the slave ones using multiple connections.
  </p>
  <p class="para">
    Database connections have a state consisting, for example, transaction
    status, transaction settings, character set settings, temporary tables.
    The plugin will try to maintain the same state among all internal
    connections, whenever this can be done in an automatic and transparent way.
    In cases where it is not easily possible to maintain state among all
    connections, such as when using <i>BEGIN TRANSACTION</i>, the
    plugin leaves it to the user to handle. Please, find further details below.
